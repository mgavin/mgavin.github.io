# Tonight's ACM Meeting with Twistlock! (2/13/2019)

[Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/) is a company that supports cloud native security for container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, Docker, and more.

We were met by John Morello, an LSU graduate who has worked with Microsoft Enterprise Services and as a Product Manager with Microsoft.
He extended the field on core crypto technologies, overseeing the creation of secure smart cards used in the federal government, the implementation of TLS into Internet Explorer, and worked on the Red-Dog project which became Microsoft Azure.

He is now the CTO for Twistlock and contributor of several blog posts regarding security in containerized software. He also authored a special publication for the National Institute of Standards in Technology ([NIST SP 800-190](https://www.twistlock.com/resources/companion-guide-nist-sp-800-190-container-security/)) describing the security risks involved in containerized applications and the effective security measures capable of mitigating risks.

He brought Twistlock to LSU and now there's a Twistlock office that operates in [LSU's innovation park](https://www.lsu.edu/innovationpark/).

Twistlock, as a service, performs [vulnerability management](https://www.twistlock.com/platform/vulnerability-management-tools/), [runtime defense](https://www.twistlock.com/platform/runtime-defense/), [compliance](https://www.twistlock.com/platform/container-compliance/), [CI (continuous integration) / CD (continuous deployment) integration](https://www.twistlock.com/platform/continuous-integration-tools/), and provides [cloud native firewalls](https://www.twistlock.com/platform/cloud-native-firewall/).

The Twistlock app itself is deployed in a container alongside other containers to create an intelligence stream about the containers currently running. It utilizes that information to assist in the operation of the services the Twistlock app performs.

Stationed in Baton Rouge are Twistlock's Solution Engineers. Described as a technical job, Solution Engineers form the backbone of the Twistlock system, providing documentation, support, and provide creative solutions to meet customer's needs.

If you would like to see more into the world of containerization, Kubernetes/Docker/orchestration systems, and cybersecurity, Mr. Morello said Twistlock was looking for interns in May and June!
He noted that interviews were mainly focused on a personality assessment and described that he was looking for people with the dedication, will, and curiousity to carry out tasks and see through new opportunities to completion. On a funny note, he asked that no one have their parents call for them for the interview.

Lastly, he suggested [katacoda](https://katacoda.com/) as an incredible resource for jumping into learning these technologies!

Definitely: Thank you to Mr. Morello for his time and for bringing incredible technological potential to Baton Rouge!
